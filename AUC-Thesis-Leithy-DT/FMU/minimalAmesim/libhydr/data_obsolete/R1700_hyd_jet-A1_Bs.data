# Table format: MULTILINES
#This file shows how to organise data to define
#properties using table in mode 1.
#
#In mode 1 density and bulk modulus are defined from a reference
#density and a table of bulk modulus values.
#
#Note all lines started with a '#' are comments.
#
#First we have the mode.
1 
#Then the number of temperature values. This must be greater
#than zero. If it is one, it is assumed that density and bulk 
#modulus do not vary with temperature.
8
#Now the ref. density in kg/m**3 and pressure in bar gauge.
813.26	0.0
#Next the first temperature in Celsius.
0.0
#Then the number of pressure-bulk modulus pairs N (greater than 0)
#followed by N pressure-bulk modulus pairs. The pressure values
#must form a strictly monotically increasing sequence.
#The pressure is in bar gauge and the bulk modulus also in bar.

#The definition of bulk modulus and density is now complete.
