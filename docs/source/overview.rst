Overview
********

The project aims at creating a flexible and efficient python open-source software development kit (SDK) 
that enables the creation, customisation and building of digital twins of robotic systems. 
The SDK is valid for developing digital twins for **Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)** and **Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs)**.
However, the SDK is designed to be easily extensible to other robotic systems.
is validated for its success. 


Through the use of a **private dockerized cloud** the synchronization of the physical and 
digital systems are made in optimal latency that allows for almost real time synchronization.
